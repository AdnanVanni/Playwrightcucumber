**Cucumber-based Automation Framework with TypeScript and Playwright**


**Overview**
This guide covers the setup of a Cucumber-based automation framework using TypeScript and Playwright. It employs the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to organize code efficiently. Playwright methods validate UI results against API responses, demonstrating the use of Cucumber World's shared context for consistent test scenarios.

**Prerequisites**
Node.js (>=14.x)

npm (>=6.x)

**Project Setup**
Initialize the Project: Create a new project directory and initialize it with npm.

Install Required Dependencies: Add necessary dependencies including Cucumber, Playwright, ts-node, TypeScript, and types for Node.

Configure TypeScript: Set up a TypeScript configuration file to specify compiler options and include paths.

Set Up CucumberJS: Create a configuration file for CucumberJS to define paths for step definitions and feature files.

Define Feature Files: Create a directory for feature files and add your scenarios to describe the applicationâ€™s functionality.

Write Step Definitions: Develop step definitions to automate the steps defined in your feature files using Playwright and TypeScript.

Implement Page Object Model (POM): Organize your code using the POM design pattern to maintain and reuse page interactions across tests.

Add Cleanup Steps: Use hooks to perform cleanup actions after tests to reset the state or clear data.

Integrate Reporting: Optionally, integrate reporting tools like Allure for detailed test reports, including execution status, error messages, and test summaries.

**Running the Tests**
Update package.json: Add scripts to run and debug your tests with CucumberJS.

Execute Tests: Use npm scripts to run your tests
